## Coding Challenge

#### In your software language of preference, please email your solutions to the following coding challenge:

1) Create a data model representing a product. Make sure to include the following properties: 
   name, price, manufacturer, and category
   
2) Create an array of 5 products, of which you decide the data for each, and then write logic that sorts the the array of products by price.

3) Write a function that takes an array of products, filters out any product greater than $30, prints out the name, price, and manufacturer of each, and then returns the resulting array.

#### You may write it directly in your email message, or include a screenshot of your code, or a link to a code snippet.
